# Geocoding and Reverse Geocoding

## Geocoding

Geocoding, also known as address geocoding, is the process of taking a text-based description of a location, such as an address or the name of a place, and returning geographic coordinates, often a pair of latitude/longitude. These coordinates identify a location on the Earth's surface. The resulting locations are generated as geographical features with attributes that can be used for mapping or spatial analysis. <a href="https://github.com/oechenique/geocoding/blob/main/Notebook/geocoding.ipynb" target="_blank">Geocoding Notebook</a>

### How Geocoding Works

Geocoding involves translating location information from descriptive text to numerical coordinates. This process is essential for various applications, including mapping services, navigation systems, and geographic information systems (GIS).

## Reverse Geocoding

Reverse geocoding is the process of converting geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) into a human-readable address or place name. <a href="https://github.com/oechenique/geocoding/blob/main/Notebook/reverse_geocoding.ipynb" target="_blank">Reverse Geocoding Notebook</a>


### Applications of Reverse Geocoding

Reverse geocoding is widely used in applications and services that require location-based information. It enables users to identify the address or place associated with a set of coordinates, enhancing the user experience in mapping applications, location-based services, and more.

## Examples

### Geocoding Example

To geocode an address using a geocoding API, you typically send a request with the address information, and the API responds with the corresponding latitude and longitude.

```python
# Example using a hypothetical geocoding API
import requests

address = "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA"
api_key = "your_geocoding_api_key"
url = f"https://geocoding-api.com?address={address}&api_key={api_key}"

response = requests.get(url)
data = response.json()

latitude = data['results'][0]['geometry']['location']['lat']
longitude = data['results'][0]['geometry']['location']['lng']

print(f"Latitude: {latitude}, Longitude: {longitude}")
```

### Example using a hypothetical reverse geocoding API

```python
import requests

latitude = 37.423021
longitude = -122.083739
api_key = "your_reverse_geocoding_api_key"
url = f"https://reverse-geocoding-api.com?lat={latitude}&lng={longitude}&api_key={api_key}"

response = requests.get(url)
data = response.json()

address = data['results'][0]['formatted_address']

print(f"Address: {address}")
```
